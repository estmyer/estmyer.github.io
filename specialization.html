			<h2><p>Endodontist</p></h2>
			<p>The crucial task of detecting, treating, and preventing infections and damage in the human dental pulp, or the nerve of the tooth, falls under the purview of the dentistry speciality known as endodontics. An endodontist could conduct a treatment like a root canal.</p>
			<h2><p>Orthodontist</p></h2>
			<p>The dental speciality of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics deals with the diagnosis, avoidance, intervention, and repair of malocclusion (poor tooth bites), as well as neuromuscular and skeletal abnormalities of growing or fully developed orofacial structures. Using braces or other orthodontic tools, an orthodontist can straighten teeth by repositioning them within the jawbone.</p>
			<h2><p>Periodontics</p></h2>
			<p>The field of dentistry known as periodontics deals with the prevention, identification, and treatment of illnesses of the gums and supporting structures of teeth, whether they are composed of natural or artificial materials. A periodontist will treat periodontal disease, often known as gingivitis, or periodontitis, which affects the gums and bones.</p>
			<h2><p>Prosthodontist</p></h2>
			<p>The dentistry speciality known as prosthodontics focuses on employing biocompatible replacements to diagnose, treat, and restore oral function associated with missing or inadequate teeth and/or oral and maxillofacial tissues. Greater than a normal dentist, a prosthodontist may restore natural teeth and replace lost ones. To replace lost or removed teeth permanently, they will use dentures or crowns (caps).</p>
