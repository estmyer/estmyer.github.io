			<h2><p>What is the DAT?</p></h2>
			<p>Your overall academic aptitude, understanding of scientific material, and perceptual skills are all assessed on the DAT (Dental Admission Test), a multiple-choice test.</p>
			<h2><p>DAT Question of the Day</p></h2>
			<p>In the pyramid of energy, the greatest amount of stored chemical bond energy is found in</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Primary Producers</p></li>
					<li><p>Secondary Producers</p></li>
					<li><p>Primary Consumers</p></li>
					<li><p>Secondary Consumers</p></li>
					<li><p>Tertiary Consumers</p></li>
				</ul>
			<h2><p>How to Prepare for the DAT</p></h2>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Give yourself at least three to four months to study for the DAT. Many sources recommend 200–250 hours. Plan on three hours per day, five days per week, for three months.</p></li>
				<li><p>Take two or three real-time simulated practice tests—this is the best way to most accurately replicate the conditions you will experience on test day.</p></li>
				<li><p>Avoid spending excessive time memorizing small details. The DAT tests critical thinking and application, not restating facts. Focus on fundamental concepts.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<img src="images/scores.png" alt="New Screen Services picture">
			<p>An average score is 17-18, a good score is 20-21, and a very high score is anything above 22.</p>
			<p>Your raw score for the DAT is the number of correctly answered questions per section. All of the multiple-choice questions are worth one raw point. You won’t get any penalties for incorrect answers so it is best to fill out the entire test, even if you end up guessing on some questions.</p>
